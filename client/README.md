The most important thing to get out of this section here is that there are two steps to reading a value with Drizzle:

First, you need to let Drizzle know what variable you want to watch for. Drizzle will give you a dataKey in return and 
you need to save it for later reference.
Second, due to the asynchronous nature of how Drizzle works, you should be watching for changes in drizzleState.
 Once the variable accessed by the dataKey exists, you will be able to get the value you are interested in.
